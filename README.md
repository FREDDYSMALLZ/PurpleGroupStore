## Online Shopping store (E-commerce)

This is online shopping center for Purple Group Enterprise that has not gone live. This application is essential for the store as it will offer convince and easiness in managing the store day to day activities. In addition, the store can save the resources used to pay for the staff and put it towards maintaining the website. 
The application is meant to attract potential buyers worldwide who have access to the internet to be able to buy goods and services at their comfort. Also, this project will offer a chance and change for the business venture into new market and change their Information security and marketing strategies.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application; using Microsoft Visual Studio application, clone the application by selecting the “Clone or download” button. Copy the link and add it to Visual studio project wizard. Complete the wizard steps and click on the “build project” to run the application for the first time. Another way is to select “Clone or download” button. Click on the “Download Zip” button to download the application to your local machine. Open Visual studio and then open the application after extracting all the project files. Select “Build project” to build the project for the first time on your machine. Run the application to view it on your default browser.   
 
 

## Prerequisites

Bellow are things you need to install in order to run the project successfully. 

1.	Computer with Windows 10 Operating System.
2.	Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition- Development environment (For coding and developing the project) 
3.	Bootstrap version 4.4.0 (Front-end framework) 
4.	Microsoft SQL server management studio- Handle database tables and store records used for the website
5.	Google Chrome Browser to run the website
6.	GitHub, Heroku, Bitbucket -Project hosting while still in development

The above listed software and framework are readily available on the internet. Majority of the framework used on the application can be updated on the Visual Studio via the NuGet package installer. 

## Running the tests

The tests below were carried out on the application to ensure that every module and component on the application worked as expected. 
* Component testing
* Unit testing
* Acceptance testing
* Requirements testing
## Importance and description of the tests

## Component testing
This is a software testing type which focuses on testing an individual component of an application without integrating with other components. This is a software testing program you may use and select. It is like a phase testing for the module by viewing your work from an architecture standpoint. For example, it is like testing your credit card platform to ensure that it works and functions properly.
## Unit testing
Unit testing is another level of software testing that involves individually testing unit of code to ensure that it works on its own, independent of the other units. Here, the purpose is to ensure that every piece of code written functions as expected. This test is carried out by the developer to ensure that individual procedures and functions are well taken care to guarantee that they are operating at their optimum level and all components associated with the units are working perfectly.
## Acceptance testing
This is a type of software testing that tests a system for acceptability. Its purpose is to evaluate the software compliance with the requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery. In other words, it is a formal system of testing that takes care of user needs, requirements and the business processes to determine whether the system satisfies the acceptance criteria.
## Requirements testing
This type of software testing is testing is done to verify and clarify whether the software requirements are feasible or 
not in terms of time, resources and budget. This is because during development, many bugs and software issues arise due 
to software inaccuracy, incompleteness and ambiguities in functional requirements. These are the most common reason why requirement 
testing needs to be done.

## Deployment
This project is deployed using Microsoft Azure AppService. Microsoft Azure provides scaling services as well as other analytic services to manage the application as well as maintenance of the application. Above all, there are added security features to prevent dependency injection and other forms of unauthorized access. 

## Built With
* [ADO.NET ] *( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/ado-net-overview) ADO.NET is a data access technology from the Microsoft .NET Framework that provides communication between relational and non-relational systems through a common set of components.
* [ASP.NET MVC5]* (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting- started/introduction/getting-started) - The web framework and architecture used.
* [Entity Framework] * (https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [.NET Framework]* (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) - Designed to build applications which could run on the Windows platform. The .Net programming language can be used to develop Forms based applications, Web based applications, and Web services.
*[Ajax Framework]* (https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp) With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.
